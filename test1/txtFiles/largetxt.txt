And I will walk you home
And I will leave you there
I'll take the books you stole
And leave a heart that bears this
I hope you have what you need
I hope the moon is listening
I hope you have what you need
I gave my soul my body
I hope you have what you need
I hope the moon is listening
I hope you have what you need
I gave you soul and body
And if things had changed
I would have buried you deep in my heart
And if things had stayed the same
I would have carried you as far as the sky
Whatever has us now
I can't forget somehow
For to forget a love is to regret
And what is love is regret
And what isn't love is a test
And if things had changed
I would have buried you deep in my heart
And if things had stayed the same
I would have carried you as far as the sky
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Hold your tongue
Hold your tongue
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Hold your tongue
Hold your tongue
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Hold your tongue
Hold your tongue
'Cause if things had changed
I would have buried you deep in my heart
And if things had stayed the same
I would have carried you as far as the sky
Far far away
Whatever has us now
I can't forget somehow
For to forget a love is to regret
